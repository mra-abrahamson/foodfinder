## 2- Installing / Getting started
### this app is designed to be easy user for our users. You just need to type this command `npm install` and then set up your account. This is a quick introduction to the setup you need to get our Food Finder app running. 

## 3- Description
### Map all public food banks in Alameda County: We are using an API or hard coding the locations of all food banks in Alameda county.   We are intentionally limiting scope on this project to provide clarity and use this as an example of the program.  Not create a universal program for the enter country right off the bat.
### Provide a way to locate the nearest: Using a mapping API we will integrate a way for the user to map from their location to the location of the food bank of their choice.  Default will be nearest food bank. 
### Translate app into multiple languages: We will have at least 6 languages available in our app to make the app available to a larger population.
### Create functionality to save to users and favorites:  We will use a database to store a set of user favorites.  We will have CRUD functionality within the users database and add/delete functionality in the favorites database.
