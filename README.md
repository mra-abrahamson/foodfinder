# Food Finder

## 1- Over View / Background
### This is Berkeley Boot Camp (Food Finder) project 3 that We provide a simple, easy to use application that will assist individuals in locating a food bank.  The project have a mapping function that will locate the nearest foodbank.  It will also be able to note when certain food banks are open and closed. The user will also have the ability to mark their favorite food banks to easily pull up later.

## 2- Installing / Getting started
### this app is designed to be easy user for our users. You just need to type this command `npm install` and then set up your account. This is a quick introduction to the setup you need to get our Food Finder app running. 

## 3- Description
### Map all public food banks in Alameda County: We are using an API or hard coding the locations of all food banks in Alameda county.   We are intentionally limiting scope on this project to provide clarity and use this as an example of the program.  Not create a universal program for the enter country right off the bat.
### Provide a way to locate the nearest: Using a mapping API we will integrate a way for the user to map from their location to the location of the food bank of their choice.  Default will be nearest food bank. 
### Translate app into multiple languages: We will have at least 6 languages available in our app to make the app available to a larger population.
### Create functionality to save to users and favorites:  We will use a database to store a set of user favorites.  We will have CRUD functionality within the users database and add/delete functionality in the favorites database.

Technologies Used:

maps-google-react





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
